                      There was a small family living in maldives in male city.
        They had two daughters.
        Oldest is called Alle and the youngest is called Alice.
        Both of them are affraid of something.
        The oldest is afraid of the dark and being alone while the youngest is afraid of the sea fearing she will drown.
        Their parents were realy worried.
        One day the father told her wife ,"Our kids can't be affraid of the dark and the sea the rest of their life".
        Then the mother replied , "what can we do? the oldest is affraid of the dark and youngest is affraid of the sea, stoping their fear wouldn't be that easy". 
        Then the father said," The only way for them to not be affraid is to face their fear".Both of them agread.</p>

        One day the father got addmission in US school for Alice.
        He told Alice that there will be much more education and since we don't have enough money instead of the plane we are going by the boat.
        Hearing it Alice was shocked she asked him,"Dad why do we have to go to America,Theirs nothing wrong with my old school."
        Then the father replied i know there is nothing wrong with your old school but if you study here in this new school you can live a better life than us.
        Alice was scared but since her father had already paid the fees she had no other option but to go to the new school.</p>

            The very next day she was going to the boat with her dad as soon as she got on the boat,she was realy scared that she hid herself in the corner  of the boat.
            It takes about several weeks to travel to america from maldives by boat.
            After a few days unexpectedly the sea got rough  that day it was raining a lot and the waves were huge.
            And the boat was rocking right and left.Everyone was moving here and there being scared.
             Now Alice is normally afraid of the sea and this time it got even worse that she cried with tears in her eyes.
            Her father told her to stop crying and pray to God so that the huge rain will stop.
            Even though Alice was scared to death she had no other choice,so she prayed and thankfully the rain stopped and the sea was back to normal</p>

                While this was happening Alle was at home. 
                One day as usual Alle's mom went to duty and said she will come a bit late and this time the worse thing is that the current has went off. 
                Alle was terrified but she calmed herself down then she used the inverter TV and watched it and eating popcorn the rest of the day.
                It was night time already. Alle finnally offed the TV but she was still scared to go to her room thinking there will be ghosts.
                So she decided to sleep in the sofa.While she was sleeping something fell on her face. 
                She was terrified and shouted but then she found out it was just a plastic cover. 
                She went to sleep again but the sofa wasn't comfortable as her bed room.
                After a few miniutes she rolled and fell then she was angry but she gotup and slept in the sofa again but she rolled and fell again.
                This time she got furious then she shouted, "I don't care about the ghosts this sofa isn't comfortable enough for me to sleep I am going to my room no matter what". 
                Alle builded up her confidents and went up to her room and after that day she wasn't affraid of the dark or being alone anymore about Alice since she got holidays she was comming back to maldives.
                This time she wasn't affraid of the sea either.</p>
                <h4>The Moral</h4>
                <p> Don't be affraid of anything because God is with you all the time</p> 
                <blockquote>
                    "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous.
                     Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go."<br>
                                                   Joshua 1:9
